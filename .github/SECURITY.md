# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not create a public GitHub issue or discussion.**

Instead, report it privately using this repository�s [GitHub private vulnerability reporting tool](https://github.com/soenneker/soenneker.utils.autobogus/security/advisories/new).

When reporting, include as much detail as possible to help us triage effectively:
- A description of the vulnerability and its context
- Clear reproduction steps (if applicable)
- Relevant logs, configs, or code snippets
- Your assessment of potential impact or severity

We aim to respond within **2 business days**, and will work with you to assess and resolve the issue promptly. If a fix requires more time, we�ll provide regular status updates until it�s resolved.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed:
- We may publish a GitHub Security Advisory
- You will be credited as the reporter (unless you request anonymity)
- A patch release and changelog update will follow

We follow [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD) best practices; working privately with reporters to verify, fix, and only publicly disclose security issues once a safe resolution is in place.
